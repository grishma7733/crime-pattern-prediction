# crime-pattern-prediction
it contains the ML code for crime pattern prediction model 
This project was developed with motive to develope such a model which will predict the crime pattern in area on the bases of area or sector we live.
project was develope so that crime solving could be more efficient. It is made using python programming languauge and machine learning algorithm  such as kneighbour classifier and decision tree classifier
By using this algorithm we were able to get accuracy upto 98%
